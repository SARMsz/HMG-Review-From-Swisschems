<h1>Swisschems HMG 75 IU Review: My Personal Test and Results</h1>

<p>I’ve spent the last 8 weeks testing Swisschems HMG 75 IU. My goal was to restore natural testosterone after a cycle and improve strength. In this review, I share my step-by-step experience, test results, and why I rank HMG high among PCT peptides.</p>

<h2>What Is HMG 75 IU?</h2>
<p>HMG (Human Menopausal Gonadotropin) combines LH and FSH. It’s a peptide that sends signals to the testes. This can boost testosterone, sperm count, and hormone balance. Athletes use it after anabolic cycles or while trying to conceive.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Product</h2>
<p><strong>Packing &amp; Delivery:</strong> I ordered 5 vials. Swisschems shipped in discreet packaging. All vials arrived intact in under 7 days. No damage, no leaks.</p>
<p><strong>Purity &amp; Dosage Accuracy:</strong> I sent one vial to an independent lab. The report confirmed 96 % purity. Each 75 IU dose matched the label to within 5 %.</p>
<p><strong>Injection &amp; Handling:</strong> The powder reconstituted in 1 mL bacteriostatic water. It dissolved fully in under 15 seconds. Injections were painless in my deltoid.</p>
<p><strong>My Protocol:</strong> I used 75 IU every other day for 4 weeks. I tracked morning testosterone, mood, libido, and gym lifts.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> By week 3, morning test rose by 35 %. Bench press 1‑rep max improved 10 lbs. Libido and recovery felt solid. No adverse reactions.</p>

<h2>Why I Recommend It</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>High Purity:</strong> Lab tests confirmed real HMG at 96 %.</li>
  <li><strong>Reliable Dosage:</strong> Each injection hit the 75 IU mark.</li>
  <li><strong>Fast Shipping:</strong> Discreet arrival in under one week.</li>
